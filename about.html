      <h2>Welcome to News Digest</h2>
      <p>
        News Digest is a web project designed to help readers explore how different media outlets frame and prioritize current events. By aggregating headlines and articles from multiple sources, the platform allows users to identify bias, compare coverage, and approach the news with a more critical and informed perspective. In addition to offering a side-by-side comparison tool, News Digest also features a personalized feed and a clean, accessible layout. This project was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and third-party APIs, with the goal of making balanced news consumption easier and more engaging for everyone.
